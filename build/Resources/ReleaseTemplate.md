## Release Notes

TODO: Fill release notes ...

### Installation Instructions

There are two kinds of archives:

* `roon-tagger-xxx-noarch.*` - These are small and contains only the
  application. They do require that you have _.Net 5.x_ runtime installed.
* `roon-tagger-xxx-<ARCH>.*` - These contains everything you need to run
  _roon-tagger_. If your architecture is not suuported (e.g. you're using a 32
  bit or ARM processor), please file an issue.

Installation is currently manual. You need to extract the archive to somewhere
in your computer. In _Windows_ you should add the directory you extracted to to
the `PATH`. On linux/osx you can symlink the `roon-tagger` executable to
somewhere in your `PATH`.
