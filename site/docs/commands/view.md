## View Roon Specific Metadata from File - _view_

View prints Roon specific metadata to the terminal. Most notably is a nice
rendering of the personnel credits (both in pretty and raw formats). This can be
useful for checking the applied personnel if you're in the middle of setting
large list of credits.

Displaying credits in raw format is useful for copying/pasting the credit to
delete in the [credits](credits.md) command.

### Example Usage
